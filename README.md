# AI CEO Platform

Run your business with an AI that acts like a CEO - giving you guidance and direction while you stay in control.

## What it does

Think of this as having an AI CEO advisor that's available 24/7. While you and your team handle the actual work, the AI CEO helps by:
- Making suggestions on business decisions
- Creating and assigning tasks to your team
- Keeping track of everything happening in your business
- Guiding you through tough choices
- Spotting problems before they get big

You're always in charge - the AI CEO is there to advise and help organize, not to take over (or fire you). You and your team make the final calls on everything.

## Main features

- Smart task management: The AI CEO helps create and prioritize work
- Business memory: Stores all your important business info in one place
- Live insights: Shows you how your business is doing in real-time
- Works everywhere: Use it on your phone, tablet, or computer
